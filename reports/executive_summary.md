# AIRLINE PASSENGER SEGMENTATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Problem Statement
Segment airline passengers to tailor experiences and offers, improving satisfaction and retention.

## Methodology
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and standardized 27 passenger features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA reduced to 6 components (80.9% variance retained)
- **Clustering**: K-Means identified 4 distinct passenger segments
- **Validation**: Silhouette analysis and business impact modeling

## Key Findings

### Cluster Profiles

**Cluster 0.0: General Travelers**
- Size: 40.7% of passengers (42,336.0 passengers)
- Current Satisfaction: 17.1%
- Priority: Low
- Revenue Opportunity: $3,175,200

**Cluster 1.0: Service Quality Enthusiasts**
- Size: 49.6% of passengers (51,523.0 passengers)
- Current Satisfaction: 66.4%
- Priority: Medium
- Revenue Opportunity: $1,731,500

**Cluster 2.0: Delay-Sensitive Travelers**
- Size: 1.4% of passengers (1,413.0 passengers)
- Current Satisfaction: 36.5%
- Priority: High
- Revenue Opportunity: $89,700

**Cluster 3.0: Delay-Sensitive Travelers**
- Size: 8.3% of passengers (8,632.0 passengers)
- Current Satisfaction: 35.7%
- Priority: High
- Revenue Opportunity: $555,100

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority (Immediate Implementation)

**Delay-Sensitive Travelers (Cluster 2.0):**
- Proactive delay notifications via SMS/email
- Priority rebooking assistance during disruptions
- Compensation packages for significant delays

**Delay-Sensitive Travelers (Cluster 3.0):**
- Proactive delay notifications via SMS/email
- Priority rebooking assistance during disruptions
- Compensation packages for significant delays

### Medium Priority (Next Quarter)

**Service Quality Enthusiasts (Cluster 1.0):**
- Premium service upgrades and amenities
- Personalized in-flight service

## Expected Impact
- **Total Revenue Opportunity**: $5,551,500
- **Average ROI**: 491.0%
- **Target Satisfaction Increase**: 5-20% across segments

## Next Steps
1. **Pilot Program**: Test high-priority actions on 10% of each cluster
2. **A/B Testing**: Measure satisfaction and retention improvements
3. **Scale Implementation**: Roll out successful strategies to full clusters
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track cluster evolution and adjust strategies

## Limitations
- Analysis based on historical data; causal relationships not established
- Feature selection may have missed important factors
- Business impact estimates are projections requiring validation
- Clusters may evolve over time requiring periodic re-analysis
